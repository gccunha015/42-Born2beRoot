Logical volumes match bonus requirements.

As I increased the size of /dev/sda2, I had to resize the physical volume to use the new space
- pvresize /dev/mapper/sda2_crypt
Created logical volumes
- lvcreate -L 5G -n home b2br
- lvcreate -L 3G -n var b2br
- lvcreate -L 3G -n srv b2br
- lvcreate -L 3G -n tmp b2br
- lvcreate -L 4G -n var-log b2br
